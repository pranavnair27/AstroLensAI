# AstroLens AI - A vision of a scalable, AI powered exoplanet detection software.
- The following is strictly a BETA work-in-progress prototype (may have bugs) for the problem statement, where our team has focused on bringing our vision to reality, by exploring various datasets and training our AI model for future use.
### P7: AI-Enabled Detection of Exoplanets from Noisy Astronomical Light Curves

AstroLens AI is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting and classifying exoplanet transit signals from noisy astronomical light curves. The project combines astrophysical signal processing with machine learning to identify potential exoplanets, estimate their orbital parameters, and provide an explainable confidence score.
Developed by Team Pratyagra for the Hack2Skill Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2026.

# Dataset

Training is performed using the Kepler Exoplanet Archive dataset.

Expected location:

```
data/
    kepler.csv
```

Required label column:

```
koi_disposition
```

Classes:

- CONFIRMED
- FALSE POSITIVE

---

# Machine Learning Model

Current classifier:

- Random Forest Classifier

Input features:

- Orbital Period

# Confidence Engine

AstroLens AI introduces an explainable confidence scoring system.

The final confidence score combines:

| Component | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Machine Learning Probability | 40% |
| BLS Detection Strength | 25% |
| Signal-to-Noise Ratio | 20% |
| Data Quality | 10% |
| Transit Consistency | 5% |

Final confidence is reported as a percentage.

# Novelty of AstroLens AI

Unlike traditional transit detection pipelines that rely solely on statistical detection, AstroLens AI integrates astrophysical analysis with explainable artificial intelligence.

Key innovations include:

- Hybrid Physics + AI pipeline
- Automated transit detection using Box Least Squares
- Machine learning based false-positive rejection
- Explainable confidence estimation
- Automated parameter estimation
- Publication-quality visualizations
- End-to-end automation from raw data to final report

The modular architecture also allows future integration of deep learning models such as CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers without redesigning the pipeline.
